Ways to get data from gradescope: 
1. Download grades -> CSV files have: First Name, Last Name, SID, Email, Total Score, Max Points, Status, 
    Submission ID, Submission Time, Lateness (H:M:S), View Count, Submission Count, 1: Autograder (100.0 pts)

2. Download student's submitted code -> gives you a zip file 

Tricky one: 
3. We can get a machine-readible results.json file with their results 

The test.py already imports JSONTestRunner and writes to RESULTS_JSON
but this is only visible for Gradescope utils

How can we access it?
1. export all submissions -> rerun autograder locally in a container: cons - time consuming

2. Screen-scrape -> not recommended, against the spirit of the platform

3. Post to your server/S3:
    - since the autograder already writes to result.json, we can upload the JSON somewhere we can control
    - option 1: HTTPS endpoint (Flask on render or FastAPI)
    - option 2: upload to S3 

    Issues:
    - technically yes outbound internet can access Gradescope
    - But, universities are responsible for FERPA compliance, and exporting students work can be a violation if not approved. 
    - If we do this, we won't be uploading names & emails, so we can use the submission IDs to match

    - it works because the file doesn't check
